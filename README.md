# Pyber_Challenge

**Overview:**

The purpose of this analysis is to determine what city type is the most profitable over the first quarter of 2019. Analyzing several charts along the way to see if anything stands out for why certain city types are more profitable than others. 

**Results:**

The results show that Urban is the most profitable city type that Pyber uses. Much of this is due to the larger population in cities and more drivers in the area. Coming in second for profitability is Suburban and the least profitable is the Rural city type. Urban areas have 80% of the drivers for Pyber which leads to more profitability.

**Summary:**

I think that there is some beneficial information we could add to this analysis. If we added a dataframe and chart with the city types population, we could see how many potential customers there would be. This would help us determine what the most profitable city type. 

But based on the information that we do have in our analysis, I would suggest investing more into Urban areas. There are significantly more drivers, more rides, and more overall profitability in this type. If you want the business to continue growing, this is the area to start in.
